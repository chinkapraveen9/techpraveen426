      1997–2002: Early career
      Prior to his career in films, Suriya worked at a garment exports factory for eight months.[19] He did not reveal himself to his boss as Sivakumar's son, but his boss ultimately learnt the truth himself.[20][21] He was initially offered the lead role by Vasanth in his film Aasai (1995), but he rejected the offer citing a lack of interest in an acting career.[14] He later debuted in Vasanth's own 1997 film Nerrukku Ner, produced by Mani Ratnam when he was 22 years of age. The stage name "Suriya" was bestowed to him by Ratnam to avoid a clash of names with established actor Saravanan. The name "Suriya" was frequently used for characters in Ratnam's films.[22] Vijay, who co-starred with him in the film, would also go on to become a leading contemporary actor in Kollywood.[23]
